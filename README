This repository hosts VHDL code developed for the course "Digital Systems and Embedded Systems" led by Jarosław Sugier at Wrocław University of Science and Technology. VHDL, which stands for VHSIC Hardware Description Language, is a hardware description language used for modeling and simulating digital systems. In this context, VHDL is employed for programming Complex Programmable Logic Devices (CPLD) on the ZL9572XL platform, as well as Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) on the Spartan-3E Starter Board.

The code within this repository showcases implementations of digital systems, embedded designs, and possibly hardware components using VHDL. The practical exercises with CPLD and FPGA boards provide with hands-on experience in designing and implementing digital circuits. Feel free to explore the VHDL code, documentation, and any additional materials included in this repository. It serves as a valuable resource for learning and applying digital system design concepts at Wrocław University of Science and Technology.
