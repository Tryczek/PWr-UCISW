## Overview

This repository contains VHDL code developed for the course "Digital Systems and Embedded Systems" taught by Jarosław Sugier at Wrocław University of Science and Technology. VHDL, or VHSIC Hardware Description Language, is utilized for programming Complex Programmable Logic Devices (CPLD) on the ZL9572XL platform and Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) on the Spartan-3E Starter Board.

## Lab Descriptions

**Lab 1: Hierarchical Project Design with Basic Modules**
- **Objective:** Design a 4-bit combinational circuit on the ZL-9572 board, implementing hierarchical projects with sub-schematics and basic I/O modules like RS232_RX, Display4x7Seg.
- **Highlights:** The lab focuses on simulation and real-world application of digital design using VHDL for combinational logic.

**Lab 2: State Machine Implementation**
- **Objective:** Develop a 3-bit bidirectional counter with a specific counting sequence, demonstrating the use of state machines (FSM).
- **Highlights:** Emphasis on the simulation of behavioral and timing aspects, challenges with CPLD programming.

**Lab 3: Describing Typical Combinational and Sequential Circuits in VHDL**
- **Objective:** Explore different levels of abstraction in VHDL descriptions for typical digital circuits.
- **Highlights:** The lab provides an in-depth look into VHDL coding, simulation, and practical issues related to digital circuit implementation.

**Lab 5: Advanced Projects Integrating State Machines and I/O Modules**
- **Objective:** Create a complex digital lock system controlled by a state machine with multiple input and output modules.
- **Highlights:** This lab combines theoretical knowledge with practical implementation skills, challenging students to create a functioning digital lock.

## Tools and Technologies
- **VHDL:** Primary hardware description language used.
- **ZL9572XL and Spartan-3E Starter Board:** Target platforms for CPLD and FPGA.
- **ISE Project Navigator and ISim:** Key software tools for code development and simulation.
