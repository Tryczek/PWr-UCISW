## Overview

This repository contains VHDL code developed for the course "Digital Systems and Embedded Systems" led by Jarosław Sugier at Wrocław University of Science and Technology. VHDL, or VHSIC Hardware Description Language, is utilized for programming Complex Programmable Logic Devices (CPLD) on the ZL9572XL platform and Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) on the Spartan-3E Starter Board.

## Lab Descriptions

**Lab 1: Hierarchical Project Design with Basic Modules**
- **Objective:** Design a 4-bit combinational circuit on the ZL-9572 board, implementing hierarchical projects with sub-schematics and basic I/O modules such as RS232_RX, Display4x7Seg.
- **Highlights:** This lab focuses on creating hierarchical digital circuits, emphasizing the design and simulation of a 4-bit combinational logic circuit using truth tables, Karnaugh maps, and logical schematics. The lab concludes with ISim simulations to validate the theoretical outputs against the simulated outcomes.

**Lab 2: State Machine Implementation**
- **Objective:** Develop a 3-bit bidirectional counter demonstrating a specific counting sequence, implemented through a state machine (FSM) approach.
- **Highlights:** Students are introduced to the design and implementation of finite state machines using VHDL. The lab involves designing a counter that follows a prescribed bidirectional sequence, supported by simulations that illustrate the behavior of the counter under different conditions.

**Lab 3: Describing Typical Combinational and Sequential Circuits in VHDL**
- **Objective:** Explore different levels of abstraction in VHDL descriptions for typical digital circuits, including a 3-bit bidirectional counter.
- **Highlights:** This lab delves into the nuances of VHDL in modeling both combinational and sequential circuits. Students learn about different methods of describing hardware behavior in VHDL, from gate-level schematics to behavioral descriptions, with a focus on effective simulation practices.

**Lab 5: Advanced Projects Integrating State Machines and I/O Modules**
- **Objective:** Create a complex digital lock system controlled by a state machine with multiple input and output modules.
- **Highlights:** This lab challenges students to apply their knowledge in a practical setting by designing a digital lock using state machines. The project integrates multiple I/O modules and simulates the entire system's operation, showcasing the practical application of digital systems in security technology.

## Tools and Technologies
- **VHDL:** Primary hardware description language used.
